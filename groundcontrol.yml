      ## Installation Notes

      You need:

      - Go >= v1.11
      - Node
      - Yarn

      By default, the Ground Control UI will be available on [http://localhost:4446](http://localhost:4446).

      To release, you need `goreleaser`. On macOS:

      ```
      brew install goreleaser/tap/goreleaser
      ```

      ### Notes
          
      #### General
          
      - Lines of code don't matter if the code can be generated. Focus on writing repeatable code then write a generator once it makes sense.
          
      #### Server
          
      - Models should only store GraphQL fields and IDs of nodes they reference. They must not store a mutex or things that are not safe to copy.
      - Queries must have no side effects (except appending the log).
          
      #### UI
          
      - Queries, mutations, subscriptions, and events should be handled as high as reasonably possible up the component tree.
      - Use snapshot testing to detect UI changes.
      - Use normal assertions for tests that shouldn't fail due to small UI changes.
