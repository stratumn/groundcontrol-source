    ## Installation Notes

    You need:

    - Go >= v1.11
    - Node
    - Yarn

    To launch the app, run these tasks in order:

    * Install UI Dependencies
    * Generate Go Code
    * Launch

    The Ground Control UI will be available on [http://localhost:3335](http://localhost:3335).

    To release, you need `goreleaser`. On macOS:

    ```
    brew install goreleaser/tap/goreleaser
    ```

    ### Notes
        
    #### General
        
    - Lines of code don't matter if the code can be generated. Focus on writing repeatable code then write a generator once it makes sense.
        
    #### Server
        
    - Use pointers to models with care. It's safer to pass a copy or the ID of a model when reasonable.
    - Models should only store GraphQL fields and IDs of nodes they reference. They must not store a mutex or things that are not safe to copy.
    - Queries must have no side effects (except appending the log).
        
    #### UI
        
    - Queries, mutations, subscriptions, and events should be handled as high as reasonably possible up the component tree.
    - Use snapshot testing to detect UI changes.
    - Use regular assertions for tests that shouldn't fail due to small UI changes.
    - Avoid using `@relay(mask: false)`.
